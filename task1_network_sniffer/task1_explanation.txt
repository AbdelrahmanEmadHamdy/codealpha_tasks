Task 1 - Basic Network Sniffer

In this task, I created a basic network sniffer using Python.

What it does:
- Captures IP packets from the network.
- Extracts source and destination IP addresses.
- Displays the protocol used.

Purpose:
- To understand how data travels over a network.
- To learn about raw sockets and IP headers.

Note:
- This script works best on Windows with admin privileges.
- The IP address must be your local machine IP.
